# Final Year Employee Attendance Monitor

This project/Repository contains the code for my Website, python scripts, .php scripts as well as logs, architecture diagrams etc. This project uses a variety of different coding languages like python, PHP, css and html.

This project allows a companys supervisior to not have to deal with the stress or worry of manually enrolling their employees attendance at work on daily basis.

From working in the production area for a few years I've seen first hand the problem this can have on an employer. Between employers paying for hours that employees have been late but have went unnoticed to when employees lose their sign in cards this product eradicates the problem as they can also sign using their fingerprint.

This project is done using Python. 

Can log two ways of Attendance which are RFID and Fingerprint. 

All the data is then pushed to a webpage. The employer can then login to the website and view the employees attendance.
